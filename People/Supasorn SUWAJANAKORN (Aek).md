Before settling down in Rayong, **I was a research resident at Google Brain working on geometric understanding in deep learning and image synthesis**. 
I finished my Ph.D. from [UW](http://www.washington.edu/) working with Prof. [Steve Seitz](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~seitz/) and Prof. [Ira Kemelmacher](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~kemelmi/) in Graphics-Vision group [GRAIL](http://grail.cs.washington.edu/). **My goal is to bring computer vision out of the lab into the real world and make it really work in the wild.** I went to Cornell for undergrad, and had a great pleasure working with Prof. [John Hopcroft](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/jeh/) on social graph algorithms, and later got inspired by Prof. [Noah Snavely](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~snavely/) with his computer vision class. 
I love hacking, coding, tackling hard problems, and I try very hard to make my solutions as simple as possible.
