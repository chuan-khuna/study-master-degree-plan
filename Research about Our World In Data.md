- The world faces many problems <- OWID focuses on

> We believe that a key reason why we fail to achieve the progress we are capable of is that we do not make enough use of this existing research and data: the important knowledge is often stored in inaccessible databases.

OWID believes that the reason why we fail to achieve the process = DATA is hard to understand/access

> The goal of our work is to make the knowledge on the big problems accessible and understandable.


We need to carefully measure what we care about and **make the results accessible in an understandable** and public platform.
