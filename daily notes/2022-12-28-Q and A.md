[[2022-12-28]] - with [[WRW]] and [[Loong Too]]

- About my stereotype - Am I `[my stereotype]` good for studying for a master degree?
	- WRW: Yes, No problems. And he listed 2-3 people that he think they has potential to study.
- Tier
	- He listed 2-3 professor and institute
	- He gave me a MEXT scholarship news
	- **Best choice is studying abroad**
- I have learnt that I can't avoid the fact that the connection/community of the university can lead me to success.
- Start from a (second) tier university then use the connection for the university I like

- "Why don't you choose the place that has all environment you need?"
