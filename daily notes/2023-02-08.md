Dear Phattharanat,

Thank you very much for your application and for your interest in our work. We regret to inform you that we have not selected your application on this occasion. 

We received a large number of applications for the role, so we unfortunately cannot offer any specific feedback. We are a very small team and we look for a very diverse set of skills for this role; how your strengths fit with the rest of the team is usually the decisive factor.

Thank you, again, for your interest and we wish you all the very best.

Kind regards, 

The Our World in Data team
