# Email Introduction


I have 6 months of experience as a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer. Most of my tasks are about providing analyses to support a strategy team.

I gained experience in the field of spatiotemporal data and time series analysis whilst working on my senior project.

I am keen on learning to create good data visualisation. I admire John Burn-Murdoch and David Spiegelhalter for their works. I have a goal to create high-quality analysis and visualisation that are **comprehensible** for non-chart people. In my free time, I enjoy watching videos from the Royal Institution to expanding my knowledge and practising English.
