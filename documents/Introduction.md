# Personal Statement/Cover Letter

Dear Our World in Data

I am writing to apply for the Data Scientist position that I saw on Twitter and Our World in Data website. I am attaching my CV and snippets of code below, as requested.

As a Data Scientist with six months of experience at The Mather, I have developed a data analysis skillset for supporting a strategy team. I provided analysis and visualisation for them to make decisions from data. The scraper scripts I have written can save the subscription cost of social listening tools.

My final project focused on multi-dimensional data and involved knowledge of spatiotemporal data and time series analysis. I became fascinated by data science and data visualisation whilst working on the project.

Moreover, I had been practising during my two-year gap before I got the job. I learnt about non-data science areas during this period, eg Personal Knowledge Management, English accents.

Our World in Data interests me because I would like to be a part of the team that creates understandable and accessible data visualisation. I take an avid interest in learning to create high-quality data visualisation. I hope to contribute to Our World in Data with my experience in climate data, machine learning and adapting my knowledge that I have gained in six months of working with The Mather.

I look forward to hearing from you. I would appreciate the opportunity to receive any feedback on my application, as I am looking for ways to improve my skills. Please let me know if you have any internship programmes available.
