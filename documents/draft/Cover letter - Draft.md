### **Personal statement structure** 

To write a persuasive personal statement, consider following this structure: 

-   Start with an opening sentence that hooks the reader
-   Put the most important information at the beginning of your personal statement (e.g. why you’re applying for the role and what makes you suitable)
-   Mention any skills and experience you have that are relevant to the job
-   Finish off with a summary of your professional goals

Tips
- [ ] Give evidence for all your claims.
- [ ] Don't repeat your whole CV.
- [ ] Yours sincerely or **yours faithfully** (GOV UK)
  - If you know the name of the person you’re writing to, you should end the letter with ‘Yours sincerely’.
  - If you’ve addressed the letter ‘Dear Sir or Madam’, you should end the letter with ‘Yours faithfully’.

I am writing to apply for the Data Scientist position that I saw on Twitter and Our World in Data website. I am attaching my CV and snippets of code below, as requested.

As a Data Scientist with six months of experience at The Mather, I have developed a data analysis skillset for supporting a strategy team. I provided analysis and visualisation for them to make decisions from data. The scraper scripts I have written can save the subscription cost of social listening tools.

- [-] I trained a Speech Emotion Recognition model for [ThaiSER](https://www.chula.ac.th/en/highlight/47904/) dataset by using Transformer architecture and achieved 60% validation accuracy which I believe that is the top performance I could do with the limited time and training environment.

My final project focused on multi-dimensional data and involved knowledge of spatiotemporal data and time series analysis. I became fascinated by data science and data visualisation whilst working on the project.

Moreover, I had been practising during my two-year gap before I got the job. I learnt about non-data science areas during this period, eg Personal Knowledge Management, English accents.

- [?] ~~I take an avid interest in learning to create good data visualisation. I admire John Burn-Murdoch and David Spiegelhalter for their works since I have a goal to create high-quality analysis and visualisation that are **comprehensible** for non-chart people. In my free time, I enjoy watching videos from the Royal Institution to expanding my knowledge and practising English.~~


- [?] Our World in Data interests me because I would like to be a part of the team that creates understandable and accessible data visualisation. I take an avid interest in learning to create high-quality data visualisation. I hope to contribute to Our World in Data with my experience in climate data, Machine Learning and adapting my knowledge that I have gained in six months of working with The Mather.
